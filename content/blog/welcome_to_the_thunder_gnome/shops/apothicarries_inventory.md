# ApothiCarrie's Inventory

## Potion of Climbing (common, dmg 187)
  * Stock: 1
  * When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.

## Potion of Healing (common, dmg 187)
  * Stock: 4
  * You regain 2d4 + 2 hit points when you drink this potion. The potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

## Potion of Fire Breath (uncommon, dmg 187)
  * Stock: 1
  * After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed. This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.

## Potion of Greater Healing (uncommon, dmg 187)
  * Stock: 2
  * You regain 4d4 + 4 hit points when you drink this potion. The potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

## Potion of Growth (uncommon, dmg 187)
  * Stock: 1
  *  When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
      * **Enlarge**. The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.

## Potion of Water Breathing (uncommon, dmg 188)
  * Stock: 1
  * You can breathe underwater for 1 hour after drinking this potion. Its cloudy green fluid smells of the sea and has a jellyfish-like bubble floating in it.

## Potion of Superior Healing (rare, dmg 187)
  * Stock: 1
  * You regain 8d4 + 8 hit points when you drink this potion. The potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

## Potion of Heroism (rare, dmg 188)
  * Stock: 1
  * For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the *bless* spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.
      * **Bless:** Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

## Potion of Clairvoyance (rare, dmg 187)
  * Stock: 1
  * Gain the effect of the clairvoyance spell
    * **Range:** 1 mile
    * **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
    * You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.
    * When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.
    * A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from *see invisibility* or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.

## Potion of Cloud Giant Strength (very rare, dmg 187)
  * Stock: 1
  * When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score ( Cloud giant 27). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.
  * This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The *potion of frost giant strength* and the *potion of stone giant strength* have the same effect.
