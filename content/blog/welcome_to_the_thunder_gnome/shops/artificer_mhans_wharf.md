# Artificer Mhan's Wharf Inventory
## Magic Arrows(Ammunition +2)
  * Price: 100gp each
  * You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition.
  * Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.

## Driftglobe
  * Price: 750gp
  * This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you are within 60 feet of it, you can speak its command word and cause it to emanate the light or daylight spell. Once used, the daylight effect can't be used again until the next dawn.
    * You can speak another command word as an action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.

  * Comment from Mhan

          If I die one of you can enter a blood pact with me
          you will be willed this ring containing my soul
          You will then be required to track down my killer and avenge me

          Should you be my killer, or fail to track them down and avenge me,
          you will be cursed and I will haunt you the rest of your days

          What do ya say, anyone want to sign on to be an avenger?
