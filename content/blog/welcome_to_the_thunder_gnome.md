Welcome to the Thunder Gnome
# Intro
  You each wake up to find yourself in a magically warded cell with a view out into a massive rusted Colosseum-like building. You know this to be The Thunderdome a structure built for the sick entertainment of **Galactus Thunderfist** the Psychotic ruler of the small city of **Maruk Dar** what used to be an Orc encampment in the Demon Wastes. Before the outbreak of the Rhonan Virus, Galactus was just a small-time Gang Leader whose territory included the Stormphrax mines outside of Maruk Dar. Once it was found that Stormphrax was the main ingredient in Elder potion, a temporary antidote for Rhonan Virus, Galactus used his power over the now incredibly precious resource to gain incredible power and become the ruler of Maruk Dar. It is known across the land that one can get a vial of Elder Potion from Maruk Dar, but at a steep cost; 100,000 GP or by winning a battle in The Thunderdome! No one can access Maruk Dar without having fought at least once in the Thunderdome.

  **The Rules of The Thunderdome:**
  1. What Galactus says goes
  2. If you are alive at the end of the battle you will receive the amount of Elder potion equal to the number of battles you have won
      * 1 battle = 1 small vial (one week of resistance)
      * 2 battles = 1 medium vial (one month of resistance)
      * 3 battles = 1 large vial (one year of resistance)
      * 4+ battles = 2 large vials (two years of resistance)
  3. Each battle will be harder than the last

  *A light mist fills the cell*
  An eerie voice plays in your head *"You have just been infected with Rhonan Virus if you do not win in the Thunderdome, you will die a slow painful death from in, inside the month. Give your best, your life depends on it."*
