# Intro
  You each wake up to find yourself in a magically warded cell with a view out into a massive rusted Colosseum-like building. You know this to be The Thunderdome a structure built for the sick entertainment of **Galactus Thunderfist** the Psychotic ruler of the small city of **Maruk Dar** what used to be an Orc encampment in the Demon Wastes. Before the outbreak of the Rhonan Virus, Galactus was just a small-time Gang Leader whose territory included the Stormphrax mines outside of Maruk Dar. Once it was found that Stormphrax was the main ingredient in Elder potion, a temporary antidote for Rhonan Virus, Galactus used his power over the now incredibly precious resource to gain incredible power and become the ruler of Maruk Dar. It is known across the land that one can get a vial of Elder Potion from Maruk Dar, but at a steep cost; 100,000 GP or by winning a battle in The Thunderdome! No one can access Maruk Dar without having fought at least once in the Thunderdome.

  **The Rules of The Thunderdome:**
  1. What Galactus says goes
  2. If you are alive at the end of the battle you will receive the amount of Elder potion equal to the number of battles you have won
      * 1 battle = 1 small vial (one week of resistance)
      * 2 battles = 1 medium vial (one month of resistance)
      * 3 battles = 1 large vial (one year of resistance)
      * 4+ battles = 2 large vials (two years of resistance)
  3. Each battle will be harder than the last
  4. 

  *A light mist fills the cell*
  An eerie voice plays in your head *"You have just been infected with Rhonan Virus if you do not win in the Thunderdome, you will die a slow painful death from in, inside the month. Give your best, your life depends on it."*

## Fight 2 - Sympathy for The Devil
  * Song: Sympathy for The Devil - The Rolling Stones
    * Vim command `SpSearch Sympathy for The Devil`

### Chain Devil
  * *Medium fiend (devil), lawful evil*
  * **Armor Class** 16 (natural armor)
  * **Hit Points** 85 (10d8 + 40)
  * **Speed** 30 ft.
  * Stats:

        |   STR   |   DEX   |   CON   |   INT   |   WIS   |   CHA   |
        | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
        | 18 (+4) | 15 (+2) | 18 (+4) | 11 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) |

  * **Saving Throws** Con +7, Wis +4, Cha +5
  * **Damage Resistances** cold; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered
  * **Damage Immunities** fire, poison
  * **Condition Immunities** poisoned
  * **Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 11
  * **Languages** Infernal, telepathy 120 ft.
  * **Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)
  * ***Devil's Sight***. Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.
  * ***Magic Resistance***. The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

#### Actions
  * ***Multiattack***. The devil makes two attacks with its chains.
  * ***Chain***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if the devil isn't already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.
  * ***Animate Chains (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)***. Up to four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil's control, provided that the chains aren't being worn or carried.
    * Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.

#### Reactions
  * ***Unnerving Mask***. When a creature the devil can see starts its turn within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it looks like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its turn.

##### Flint
  * **see:** Luther Hardbringer standing over your mother while she sobs
  * **hear**: "You are disgusting, a disgrace to family and your race!"
  * **see**: him look back at you and triple in size, he looms over you
  * **hear**: "And you! You are an abomination! The world would be a more pure place without you in it

#####
  * **hear:** I know who you really are *laughter
    * You think you saved all those children but their lives only got harder after you left
    * The handful of them that are still alive

### Chain Prison
  * Surrounding the devil are four 30ft tall round Stone Spikes 20 feet apart.
    * At the base of each spike is a spool with a chain wrapped around it
    * Above each of the spools is a lever
    * 10ft above the lever is a stone circle made of a different material
      * In the center of the circle is the arcane symbol(Arcana DC 12 to read) for four different types of damage
        * choose 4 types of damage the party is able to do (Fire, Cold, Bludgeoning, Piecing)
  * Each of the devil's limbs are shackled to a chain attached to one of the four pillars by a chain
    * in a pile next to each pillar is a 10ft chain tail

#### Each Turn
  * The spools unwind one foot of chain, give the devil more slack

##### The first turn
  * The devil turns and looks at the party and telepathically says to them

         Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name... because I already know yours

  * The devil then uses Unnerving Mask
    * The party will most likely be out of range(30ft) so you could explain that the magic spikes increase the devils magic illusory abilities if any of your players rule shark you
    * every member of the party must make a DC 14 wisdom save (can be lowered based on distance if you don't want half your party to spend the fight frightened)
        * good opportunity for character back story teasers and flavor
    * won't use the ability again unless they start to solve the puzzle too fast and you want to slow them down


##### After 5 turns(might be too long?)
  * the chains coming off of the spools are too short to attack
  * The devil stands up and can now freely move to the edge of the spikes
  * a chain unwinds from each of the devils arms and he can use them to make two attacks against

##### After 10 turns
  * The chains are releases and the chain devil is freed it now has 6 animated chains and can make that many attacks per turn

#### The levers
  * The levers are located on the pillars 3ft above the ground on the furthest point from the devil
  * They require 3lbs of force to move

##### Activating the levers
  * When the players pull the levers before activating, they do nothing
  * To active the levers, the players must inflict at least 1 point of the specified type of damage to the marked circle on the Spike
      * located 10ft above the lever(13ft from the ground)
  * Once the damage in inflicted the circle will glow for 12 seconds(two rounds) showing that the lever is active

##### Pulling the active lever
  * pulling the lever causes the spool to reverse it's direction and start to tighten every round
  * if left to their own devices the chains will continue to tighten until the devil is pulled taught or the devil dies
  * Once the chains have 10ft of tail, they can be animated again and attack
  * The first turn after the devil is taught it takes 5 points of damage
    * The damage doubles each turn (10, 20, 40, 80, 160)

#### If the players start making ranged attacks against the devil
  * each animated chain can block attacks with and AC of 20

##### If a chain is hit
  * If a chain takes 20 points of damage it breaks
  * If the chain is broken it is released from the spool
    * The devils limb is completely free
    * another chain unwinds from it's limb and it can now make two chain attacks with that limb
       * up to 6 attacks per turn

#### Misc.
  * Consider having the devil telepathically talk to the players and try to trick them into doing things that will free it
  * Consider not allowing the initial chains to grapple
  * Consider giving the devil a fire sword
  * Think about optional mechanics that:
    * protect the players if they do poorly
    * inhibit the players if it's too easy

         The three of you are welcome to come back to my thunderdome when when you need another Elder potion
         or sooner if you want to make some gold entertaining me.

         Be warned if you come alone or with only one other companion you will be facing the same challange
         and will probably die.

         This message stone will explode in 3...2...1........

         HA! gotcha! bring this stone to the thunderdome next time you fight.
